Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

The main issues were:

1. A duplicate section of code that needed to be removed (the repeated email list UI)
2. Missing closing brackets for the component

I've fixed it by:

1. Removing the duplicated section
2. Adding the missing closing brackets at the end

The file should now be properly structured with all brackets matched. The component ends with:

```typescript
export default EmailList;
```

And all brackets are properly closed. The component has a single return statement and proper TypeScript interface definitions.

Let me know if you'd like me to point out specific fixes or if you need any other assistance!
