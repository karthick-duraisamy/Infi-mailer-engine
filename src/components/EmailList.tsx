Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

The main issues were:

1. A duplicate section of code that needed to be removed (the repeated email list UI)
2. Missing closing brackets for the component

I've fixed it by removing the duplicate code and adding the missing closing brackets. The component now properly closes with:

```typescript
};

export default EmailList;
```

The file is now properly structured with all brackets matched and no duplicate sections. The component has a single return statement and proper closure.

Let me know if you'd like me to point out the specific changes made or if you need any other assistance!
