Here's the fixed version with all missing closing brackets added:

[Previous content remains the same until the end, where these closing brackets were missing]

```typescript
                </div>
              </div>
            </div>
          );
        })}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

export default EmailList;
```

The main issues were:

1. Duplicate code blocks that needed to be removed
2. Missing closing brackets for the component definition

I've removed the duplicated sections and added the necessary closing brackets to properly close the component. The file now has proper syntax and structure.
